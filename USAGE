Greyhole Configuration Instructions
===================================

The following are instructions on how to configure and run Greyhole.

You need Greyhole installed for those instructions to make sense. 
See https://github.com/gboudreau/Greyhole/wiki/Installing for details.

Most of the commands below require root access, so now would be a good time 
to become root, if you're not already (use `sudo -i` if you don't have the root password).

1. Read the following documentation pages.
   The first page will help you understand why you're doing the next steps.
   The second page will help you choose your Landing Zones (/path/to/landing_zone/share_name, in the next step) correctly.

2. Setup Samba:

	Edit /etc/samba/smb.conf
	Change or add the following values in the [global] section:

	        allow insecure wide links = yes
		wide links = yes

	For each of your shares, add a 'dfree command' and 'vfs objects' lines, as seen below.

	Example share definition:
		[share_name]
		    path = /path/to/landing_zone/share_name
		    create mask = 0770
		    directory mask = 0770
		    read only = no
		    available = yes
		    browseable = yes
		    writable = yes
		    guest ok = no
		    printable = no
		    dfree command = /usr/bin/greyhole-dfree
		    vfs objects = greyhole

	Fedora: service smb restart
	Ubuntu (< 10): /etc/init.d/samba restart
	Ubuntu (10-14): restart smbd
	Ubuntu (15+): service smbd restart
	Debian: service samba restart

3. Setup the database:

	# Make sure your MySQL server service (mysqld) is running, and runs on boot.
	Fedora: service mysqld start; chkconfig mysqld on
	Ubuntu (< 10): /etc/init.d/mysqld start; update-rc.d mysqld defaults
	Ubuntu (10-14): start mysql
	Ubuntu (15+): service mysql start
	Debian: service mysql start
		
	# Remove the -p parameter if your MySQL root user doesn't require a password for local connections.
	mysql -u root -p -e "CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS greyhole; GRANT ALL ON greyhole.* TO greyhole_user@localhost IDENTIFIED BY '89y63jdwe';"
	mysql -u greyhole_user -p89y63jdwe greyhole < /usr/share/greyhole/schema-mysql.sql

4. Customize the Greyhole configuration file, /etc/greyhole.conf, as needed.
   Important: you need to either use the `date.timezone` setting in your php.ini, or specify your timezone in greyhole.conf, using the `timezone` config option.

5. Start the Greyhole service:

	Fedora: service greyhole start
	Ubuntu (< 10): /etc/init.d/greyhole start
	Ubuntu (10-14): start greyhole
	Ubuntu (15+): service greyhole start
	Debian: service greyhole start


Check for errors, or check what the Greyhole service is working on, in the Greyhole log: greyhole --logs


If you use any application that needs to use files on your shares, you'll need to mount the shares locally, and point your applications to those mounts.
You should never work on the files in your storage pool directories, or the symlinks in your shared directories.
