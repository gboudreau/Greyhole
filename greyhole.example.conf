# This file is part of Greyhole.

#### Database Connection ####
# Available engines: mysql, sqlite
# When choosing sqlite, 'db_host', 'db_user', 'db_pass' & 'db_name' options are not required, but 'db_path' is.

	db_engine = mysql
	db_host = localhost
	db_user = greyhole_user
	db_pass = 89y63jdwe
	db_name = greyhole
	#db_path = /var/cache/greyhole.sqlite

#### Email Recipient ####
# Will receive email reports for daily fsck, or when all drives are out of 
# available space.
# When specifying no @hostname, the email will be delivered to the local 
# mailbox of that user.

	email_to = root
	#email_to = root@test.com

#### Greyhole Log File ####

	greyhole_log_file = /var/log/greyhole.log

# Available verbosity levels: DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, CRITICAL
# Note that for --status to work correctly, you'll need to keep this to DEBUG.

	log_level = DEBUG

# Log Greyhole memory usage on each log line?

	log_memory_usage = no

# Look for other processes working on files on the Greyhole shares?
# Disable to get more speed, but this might break some files, if any 
# application change your files while Greyhole tries to work on them.

	check_for_open_files = yes

#### Shares Settings ####
# Number of copies of each file you want Greyhole to keep, per Share.
# This is not the number of duplicates! 2 copies = 1 duplicate
# If you change one of those, you should run fsck manually, or wait for the 
# daily fsck, to have the additional copies created, or extra copies deleted.
#
# Example:
#
#	num_copies[Backups] = 2
#	num_copies[CrashPlan] = 2
#	num_copies[Games] = 2
#	num_copies[Music] = 2
#	num_copies[Photos] = max # This will insure those files are on all HDD
#	num_copies[RecordedTV] = 1
#	num_copies[Software] = 2
#	num_copies[TimeMachine] = 1
#	num_copies[Videos] = 2

#### Storage Pool ####
# Where should the file copies be kept?
# You probably want to list all your physical hard drives here.
# Also specify how much free space you want to reserve on each drive. This is 
# a soft limit that will be ignored if the necessary hard drives are below 
# their minimum.
# For example, if you specify a 100 GB limit on all drives, and only one still 
# have more than 100 GB of free space, and you save a new file on a share for 
# which you specified you want multiple copies, this drive will be used first, 
# but the other drives that have less free space will be used to store the 
# additional copies.
#
# Example:
#
#	storage_pool_directory = /mnt/hdd0/gh, min_free: 10gb
#	storage_pool_directory = /mnt/hdd1/gh, min_free: 10gb
#	storage_pool_directory = /mnt/hdd2/gh, min_free: 10gb
#	storage_pool_directory = /mnt/hdd3/gh, min_free: 10gb

### Directory selection groups ###
# The groups you define here will be available to use in the 
# dir_selection_algorithm option(s) below.
# The group names (OK, NEW, BROKEN, REMOTE in the example below) can be 
# anything you'd like.
# Use one line per group, with the following syntax:
#   group name: one or more (comma-separated) storage pool directories
# If you ommit any storage pool directory from your groups, this directory 
# will NOT be used by Greyhole!
#
# See https://github.com/gboudreau/Greyhole/wiki/SuggestedStorageSelectionAlgorithmUsage
#   on how we suggest you use this feature.

#	dir_selection_groups = OK: /mnt/hdd0/gh, /mnt/hdd2/gh
#	                       NEW: /mnt/hdd1/gh
#	                       BROKEN: /mnt/hdd3/gh
#	                       REMOTE: /mnt/remote1/gh

# You can also define dir_selection_groups for specific shares:
#
#	dir_selection_groups[Photos] = SATA: /mnt/hdd0/gh
#	                               IDE: /mnt/hdd1/gh, /mnt/hdd2/gh
#	                               USB: /mnt/hdd3/gh

#### Storage Selection Algorithm ####
# available algorithms: random, most_available_space
#   most_available_space: use the directories with the most available space 
#     first, so that available space on all drives should become and stay 
#     balanced.
#   random: use a random directory with available space

	dir_selection_algorithm = most_available_space

# If you defined dir_selection_groups above, you'll want to use them here.
# Use the 'forced' keyword, then list the groups you want to use, in order, and 
# prefix each group name with the number of directories you want to use from 
# that group before using the next group.
# Use the 'all' keyword to indicate you want Greyhole to use all directories 
# from a specific group, before starting to use directories from the next group.
# You'll need to indicate how Greyhole should pick drives within a group by 
# ending your line with either random or most_available_space.
#
#	dir_selection_algorithm = forced (1xOK, 1xNEW, 1xBROKEN, 1xREMOTE) most_available_space

# You can also define dir_selection_algorithm for specific shares:
#
#	dir_selection_algorithm[Videos] = random
#	dir_selection_algorithm[Photos] = forced (all SATA, 1xIDE, 1xUSB) random

#### Sticky Files ####
# Sticky files are files that will always 'live' together, in the storage pool.
#
# This will allow you to read (and read-only!) those files by using the 
# storage pool directories themselves, instead of using the mounted shares.
# To see when that might be useful, read Issue #3 at the URL below.
# [http://code.google.com/p/greyhole/issues/detail?id=3]
#
# Each sticky_files line should start with the name of a share, followed by a 
# directory inside that share.
# One or more stick_into lines should follow each sticky_files line, if you 
# want the files to go on specific hard drive(s).
# If you don't specify any stick_into, the drive with the most free space will 
# be use to hold your files together.

	sticky_files = Music/

#	sticky_files = Videos/Movies/
#		stick_into = /mnt/hdd1/gh
#		stick_into = /mnt/hdd5/gh

# How long should free space calculations be cached (in seconds).
# When selecting drives using their available / free space, the last cached 
# value will be used.
# Use 0 to disable caching.

	df_cache_time = 15

#### Trash ####
# Move deleted files to trash, instead of deleting them?
# (Yes, trash is just another name for a Recycle Bin.)
# You can specify per-share preferences that will override the global 
# preference.

	delete_moves_to_trash = yes
#	delete_moves_to_trash[CrashPlan] = no
#	delete_moves_to_trash[TimeMachine] = no

#### Balance with modified files ####
# Change this to 'yes' to use modified files copies to help balance the 
# available space in your storage pool directories.
# Note that this will force Greyhole to remove outdated copies, and 
# re-create them on the drive(s) with the most available space.
# When set to 'no', existing copies will be kept, and updated using rsync.

	balance_modified_files = no

#### Frozen directories ####
# Directories listed below will not be touched by Greyhole until the user 
# wants it to (greyhole --thaw=<dir>).
#
# This can be used to process often-updated files at regular intervals, 
# instead of having Greyhole process them as soon as they change.
#
# Each frozen_directory line should start with the name of a share, followed 
# by a directory inside that share.

#	frozen_directory = Data/mysql

#### Maximum Queued Tasks ####
# Maximum number of queued tasks to store in MySQL/SQLite, when parsing the 
# spool directory. Use a lower number if you experience slowness while parsing 
# spooled operations.
# Default is 10000000 when using MySQL, and 1000 when using SQLite.
# Setting a value here will overwrite those defaults.

#	max_queued_tasks = 10000000

#### Memory Limit ###
## Maximum amount of ram that Greyhole can consume while running
## this can be higher than the global php.ini memory limit
## if greyhole uses >95% of available memory while loading
## data it will quit and throw an error in the logs
# Default is 128M
# Setting a value here will overwrite this default.
# It is NOT advisable to lower the memory limit.
#        memory_limit = 128M

#### Copy Method ####
# Possible values: cp, rsync
# cp is less CPU-intensive, and generally faster than rsync, which is still 
# available for backward compatibility

#	copy_method = cp
